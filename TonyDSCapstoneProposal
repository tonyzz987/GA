Zhe Zheng (Tony) Capstone Project Proposal

Problem: Where is the safest place to avoid covid-19, according to data

Hypothesis: Wealthy neighborhoods of big cities and isolated villages will be the safest, but isolated villages can be dangerous if it was exposed as it has little resources. Also smaller villages are having less population, a family got infected in a small village will be a big increase. A family got infected in a city barely effected the percentage, even if a family in big city got infected will be more likely to infect their friends and neighbors.


Goals and success metric: to find the death per infection, quantity of infection and death in the year of 2020. Discovering which counties has the highest/lowest infections and deaths, and look up whether the counties located inside a metropolitan area, suburb, or a small town.

Risk and limitation: As population is unprovided in the dataset, and it changes daily as people are moving in/moving out, death and birth, it is hard to have a precise infection rate or death rate. In addition, the US Census data doesn't go to full detail to county level, thus it is only get to state level when it gets to infection rate per state.
